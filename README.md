The application uses MAMP, the local server environment to connect to the database, therefore, in order to run it, first step is to download and install MAMP, unless you already have it.

The next step is to set the MySQL port  number  to "3306" in MAMP preferences. Start the server by clicking the button "Start" and you are good to go. Run the app with "gradle run"
command.
