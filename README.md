# Cookbook App

The application uses MySQL, the local server environment to connect to the database, therefore, in order to run it, first step is to download and install MySQL, unless you already have it. The next step is to set the MySQL port number to "3306", database user  and database password in MySQL preferences. Start the server and run the app with "gradle run" command.
