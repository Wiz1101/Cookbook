App is 'fine'. Some features were still missing. FAQ wasn't done by the last meeting, 
nor was the weekly dinner lists, so some features were missing.
Group felt pretty 'good' in terms of chemistry - they worked together 
fairly well. Their codebase looks pretty well thought out. Gitlab management is acceptable.

Grade: C
