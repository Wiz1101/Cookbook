STEP 4: Baste, baste, baste – Immediately after you’ve added the garlic and even before it has had a chance to go golden, start basting. To do this, tilt the pan slightly so the butter pools on one side. Then scoop up the butter using a large spoon and spoon it over the salmon. The garlic will cook as you baste so by the time the salmon is done, the garlic is perfectly golden. STEP 5: Baste 1 1/2 minutes – Baste for 1 1/2 minutes in total, which should be a total cooking time of around 3 minutes for the second side (1 minute cooking after turning + 30 seconds butter melting time + 1 1/2 minutes basting). Target an internal temperature of 50°C/122°F for medium-rare (optimum juiciness), with the thermometer inserted into the middle of the thickest part of the salmon.
